# IT Equipment Lifecycle & Salvage Flow

## Overview

This document describes the complete IT equipment lifecycle management system implemented in the Asset Management System. The system provides a finite state machine for asset lifecycle management with full audit trail and chain-of-custody tracking.

## Lifecycle States

The system implements the following lifecycle states:

1. **InStorage** - Asset is in storage at a site (same building, floor = "Storage")
2. **ReadyForShipment** - Asset is ready for pickup by Facilities Drivers
3. **InTransit** - Asset is being transported by Facilities Drivers
4. **Delivered** - Asset has been delivered to destination
5. **Deployed** - Asset is deployed to a user/desk
6. **RedeployPending** - Asset is scheduled for redeployment
7. **SalvagePending** - Asset is marked for salvage (cannot be redeployed)
8. **Salvaged** - Asset has been processed through salvage (locked/read-only)

## State Transitions

### Allowed Transitions

- **InStorage** → ReadyForShipment, Deployed
- **ReadyForShipment** → InTransit (only by Facilities Drivers)
- **InTransit** → Delivered (only by Facilities Drivers)
- **Delivered** → InStorage, Deployed
- **Deployed** → RedeployPending, SalvagePending, ReadyForShipment
- **RedeployPending** → Deployed, InStorage, ReadyForShipment
- **SalvagePending** → ReadyForShipment (cannot be redeployed)
- **Salvaged** → No further transitions (terminal state)

### Business Rules

- **SalvagePending** assets cannot be redeployed - they can only be shipped for salvage
- Only **Facilities Drivers** can pick up assets marked as **ReadyForShipment**
- Only **Facilities Drivers** can deliver assets in **InTransit** state
- **Salvaged** assets are read-only except Notes and SalvageBatchId
- Only assets in specific states can be transferred (InStorage, Delivered, RedeployPending, SalvagePending)

## Storage Management

### Automatic Storage Assignment

When assets are moved to storage (InStorage state), the system automatically:

1. **Sets Floor to "Storage"** - No user prompt required
2. **Sets CurrentStorageLocation** - Automatically assigned as "{Site} Storage" (e.g., "LIC Storage", "66JOHN Storage")
3. **Maintains CurrentSite** - Preserves the site location for tracking
4. **Same Building** - Asset stays in the same building, just moved to storage area

**Example:**
- Asset at LIC moved to storage → Floor = "Storage", CurrentStorageLocation = "LIC Storage", Location = "LIC"
- Asset at 66JOHN moved to storage → Floor = "Storage", CurrentStorageLocation = "66JOHN Storage", Location = "66JOHN"

### Storage Locations

Each location has its own storage area, typically within the IT room:
- **LIC Storage** - Located in LIC IT room
- **66JOHN Storage** - Located in 66 John St IT room  
- **Bronx Storage** - Located in Bronx IT room
- **Brooklyn Storage** - Located in Brooklyn IT room

## Shipment Workflow

### Ready for Shipment

When an asset is marked as "Ready for Shipment":
1. Asset moves to **ReadyForShipment** state
2. Asset is placed in pickup area at the site
3. Only **Facilities Drivers** can pick up these assets
4. Asset cannot be deployed until picked up and delivered

### Pickup by Facilities Drivers

When a Facilities Driver picks up an asset:
1. Asset transitions from **ReadyForShipment** → **InTransit**
2. Driver records destination site, carrier, and tracking number
3. Asset is physically transported to destination
4. Full audit trail is maintained

### Delivery Process

When asset arrives at destination:
1. Facilities Driver marks asset as **Delivered**
2. Asset moves to **Delivered** state
3. Asset is placed in delivery area at destination site
4. Receiving personnel can then reassign location via asset tag

### Location Reassignment After Delivery

When asset is delivered:
1. Personnel scans asset tag
2. Calls `POST /api/lifecycle/reassign-location-after-delivery`
3. Asset location is updated (Location, Floor, Desk)
4. Asset is ready for deployment or storage

## Salvage Data Management

### Minimal Data Retention

When an asset is marked for salvage (SalvagePending state), the system automatically clears sensitive data while retaining minimal identifying information:

**Data Cleared (for reuse):**
- IP Address (can be reassigned to new equipment)
- MAC Address
- Wall Port
- Switch Name/Port
- Net Name
- Assigned User/Email
- Phone Number/Extension
- Desk assignment
- Deployment tracking data

**Data Retained (for identification):**
- Asset Tag
- Serial Number
- Manufacturer
- Model
- Location/Current Site
- Notes
- All procurement/audit fields (Purchase Price, Vendor, Warranty, etc.)

### Salvage Process

1. **Mark for Salvage** → Clears sensitive data, retains minimal identification (cannot be redeployed)
2. **Ready for Shipment** → Asset ready for pickup by Facilities Drivers
3. **InTransit** → Asset being transported to salvage location
4. **Delivered** → Asset arrives at salvage location
5. **Add to Salvage Batch** → Groups for pickup
6. **Finalize Salvage** → Locks asset as read-only with minimal view

## Operations

### 1. Asset Deployment

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/lifecycle/deploy`

Deploy an asset to a user/desk:

```json
{
  "assetTag": "LAPTOP-001",
  "desk": "A-101",
  "userName": "John Doe",
  "userEmail": "john.doe@company.com"
}
```

**Effects:**
- Sets LifecycleState = Deployed
- Updates CurrentDesk, DeployedAt, DeployedBy, DeployedToUser, DeployedToEmail
- Creates audit event

### 2. Asset Replacement

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/lifecycle/replace`

Replace an old asset with a new one:

```json
{
  "oldAssetTag": "LAPTOP-001",
  "newAssetTag": "LAPTOP-002",
  "desk": "A-101",
  "userName": "John Doe",
  "userEmail": "john.doe@company.com",
  "oldAssetToSalvage": true
}
```

**Effects:**
- New asset → Deployed at desk
- Old asset → SalvagePending (clears sensitive data, cannot be redeployed) or RedeployPending
- Creates linked audit events for replacement tracking

### 3. Asset Redeployment

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/lifecycle/redeploy`

Redeploy an asset to a new desk or move to storage:

```json
{
  "assetTag": "LAPTOP-001",
  "newDesk": "B-205"
}
```

**Effects:**
- If newDesk provided: RedeployPending → Deployed
- If newDesk null: RedeployPending → InStorage (auto-assigns storage location)

### 4. Move to Storage

**Endpoint:** `POST /Assets/MoveToStorage`

Move an asset to storage (no storage location prompt required):

```json
{
  "assetTag": "LAPTOP-001"
}
```

**Effects:**
- Sets LifecycleState = InStorage
- Automatically sets Floor = "Storage"
- Automatically sets CurrentStorageLocation = "{Site} Storage"
- Asset stays in same building

### 5. Ready for Shipment

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/lifecycle/mark-ready-for-shipment`

Mark asset as ready for pickup by Facilities Drivers:

```json
"LAPTOP-001"
```

**Effects:**
- Sets LifecycleState = ReadyForShipment
- Records ReadyForPickupAt and ReadyForPickupBy
- Asset cannot be deployed until picked up and delivered

### 6. Pickup Asset (Facilities Drivers Only)
